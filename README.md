# Crab Journey

Crab Journey is a 2D pixel art puzzle platformer in which we play as a little crab going on a big adventure to the depths of the ocean in search of a new shell.
Along the way you explore, collect and cut trash, solve puzzles, climb corals and have a hard time looking away (because the crab is so cute :D ).
